# Dinning Philosophers
Repository for solving the Dinning Philosophers problem. The problem statement can be found [here] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem). <br/>
I used two different approaches to solve this problem: <br/>
* Semaphores, implemented using the C include *<semaphores.h>*
* Monitor, implemented in C using mutexes from the include *<pthread.h>*.
